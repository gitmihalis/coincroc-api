		There are thousands of crypto-coins available for exchange across the web today, but what do they do? It’s the ~goal of this website to classify them into their respective industries and ~uncover trends within this emerging market for investment perspective. Because anyone and everyone can create their own crypto asset, the coming years will realize the market as it’s defined by trial and error. As one can see in the stock market, certain sectors grow and outpace others, and by that measure, can warrant investment over others industries which offer greater risks.
